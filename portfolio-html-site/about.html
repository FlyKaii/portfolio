                <h1>A little bit about me....</h1>
                <p>My name is Kai Thayer, as you probably noticed by the name in the top right...</p>
                <p>At the time of writing this I am 21 years old, born 28th of July, 2000. I've always enjoyed messing around with computers since I was young, and this is what initially kickstarted my creative mind. </p>
                <p>I first discovered how much I liked graphics design when I got my first proper laptop, when I was younger I would play Minecraft with my friends and we would record our gameplay, I wanted to be a big YouTuber with lots of views and to do that I needed pretty looking thumbnails. I remember downloading Photoshop just to learn how to make nice thumbnails and that was it, but I fell in love. I then moved on to After Effects, as I wanted an opening animation for my channel, I had loads of fun making them and I would offer to make them for anyone I knew.</p>
                <p>My channel never really took off, however, my interest in graphics design and motion design always stayed, I've always struggled with knowing what I want to do & achieve in life, but through it all I've always bounced back to my graphics.</p>
                <p>I recently decided that if I wanted to take graphics design seriously, I would need a good portfolio, and so I decided to code my own website to host my work. In doing so, I've found out that I absolutely love web design and would love to pursue it as a career.</p>
